In PHP, __DIR__ is a magic constant that represents the directory of the current script. 
It provides the absolute file path to the directory where the file is located, 
and it doesn't include the trailing slash at the end.
If your script is located at /var/www/html/myproject/index.php, then __DIR__ will return /var/www/html/myproject.
If your script is inside a subdirectory like
 /var/www/html/myproject/subdir/script.php, __DIR__ will return /var/www/html/myproject/subdir.

 so the var_dump(__DIR__);
 string(24) "C:\xampp\htdocs\workopia"
